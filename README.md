This project is based on FMCG domain, in which I have performed the following step :
-> Established the connection between Power BI and MySQL, as source of data is a SQL database
-> Calculated DAX measures and added new columns using DAX, to deduce the useful insights from the data
-> used knowledge of financial analysis and constructed various visuals such as for profit and loss statement, Net sales, comparison of data from previous year etc.
-> Done report beautification to make is visually appealing and easy to understand

-> Dynamic slicers and headers can be made using switch statement
-> Align and group option under "Format" tab is useful for report beautification
